# Tucson Golden Doodles üêæ

This Flask-based web application is designed to showcase Golden Doodle puppies. It uses a modern technology stack to handle everything from the web interface and database interactions to cloud-based image storage.

---

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

The application is built with a robust and scalable technology stack, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

### Core Framework & Backend

* **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework that provides the foundation for routing, request handling, and rendering templates.
* **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows for database interactions using Python objects instead of raw SQL.
* **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask for a more streamlined development experience.
* **Alembic**: A database migration tool used with SQLAlchemy to manage and version database schemas.
* **Flask-Migrate**: Integrates Alembic with Flask for easier database migrations.
* **PyMySQL**: A Python driver for connecting to a MySQL database.

### Admin & Authentication

* **Flask-Admin**: Provides a secure and feature-rich administrative interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database models.
* **Flask-Login**: Manages user authentication for the admin panel, including user sessions and protecting routes from unauthorized access.

### Frontend

* **Bootstrap 5**: A popular CSS framework that ensures the website is responsive and looks great on all devices.
* **Jinja2**: A templating engine used by Flask to render dynamic HTML pages by embedding Python-like logic into HTML files.
* **Flask-WTF**: Integrates the WTForms library with Flask for creating and validating web forms.

### Cloud Integration ‚òÅÔ∏è

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**: Used for storing and managing all user-uploaded images. This approach is highly scalable, reliable, and separates static assets from the application server.
* **Boto3**: The official AWS SDK for Python, used to communicate with AWS services like S3.

### Development & Testing

* **Python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys out of the source code.
* **Pytest**: A testing framework used for writing clean, organized tests to ensure the application's components work as expected.
* **Flask-Caching**: Implements caching to improve performance by storing the results of expensive operations, like generating pre-signed S3 URLs.
